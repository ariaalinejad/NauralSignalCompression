# NauralSignalCompression

Abstract: 
</br>
Brain disorders like Dementia and Parkinson’s affect millions and are one of the
biggest health problems that the world faces today. However, we are limited by
a lack of mechanical understanding of the brain [1]. To address this, research
is being conducted to develop wireless brain monitoring devices for use on rats.
This report will explore compression techniques that can be used to enable the
development of these devices by reducing power consumption. Various methods
including Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM), Adaptive Rice Coding,
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and MS Quadro will be evaluated, and their
effectiveness in compressing Local Field Potentials (LFPs), Extracellular Action
Potential (EAPs), Electrocorticography (EcoG) signals, and Electromyography
(EMG) signals will be demonstrated. This report also provides an analysis of
the signal characteristics of these four signals and their signal applications, and
provides discussions of prior research, results, and future work in light of this.
The MS Quadro method, combined with FIR filtering, DPCM, and Adaptive Rice
coding, achieved a compression rate of 40-50% without compromising information
integrity. This method’s low hardware and computational demands suggest the
potential for additional power savings, which has the potential to facilitate the
creation of a wireless system for monitoring rat brain activity.
